# Telewire-Analytics---Connetwork---Data-Science-project
Data Science project

Telewire Analytics utilizes a range of cutting-edge technologies to build the system, including Python, Flask, and machine learning libraries such as Scikit-learn and Tensorflow. The project includes a data preprocessing pipeline to clean and transform raw data, and data visualization tools to help visualize and analyze the data.

The system uses advanced machine learning algorithms such as clustering, classification, and anomaly detection to identify patterns and anomalies in the data. The machine learning models are trained on historical data and updated in real-time as new data is collected.

In addition to the data analytics and machine learning components, the project also includes a data pipeline that collects data from cell towers in real-time, processes it, and stores it in a database. The pipeline ensures that data is consistently collected and processed, allowing for accurate analysis and detection of anomalies.

Overall, Telewire Analytics is a comprehensive project that leverages the latest in machine learning and data analytics to help cell tower companies optimize their resources and reduce their environmental impact. By providing valuable insights into network performance, the project helps to ensure that cell tower companies can deliver reliable, high-quality service to their customers.
